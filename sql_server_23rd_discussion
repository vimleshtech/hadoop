Union 
Join
Subquery
View 


Union : is keyword which merge two or more than two tables vertically
======================
->Table structure should be same: datatype and column sequence 
Example:
	Emp: all active in this table
	Emp_history: all inactive record in this table
->we want to merge these table virtually and show as a single table

There are following types of union:
1. union 		: return all unique rows
	table: a
		1  a
		2 b
	table: b
		3 c
		1 d
		2 b

	ouput:
		1 a
		2 b
		3 c
		1 d 

2. union all 		: return all rows
	table: a
		1  a
		2  b
	table: b
		3 c
		1 d
		2 b
	ouput:
		1 a
		2 b
		3 c
		1 d 
		2 b	 

Join : to merge two or more than two tables based on common column/attribute
=============	
->At least one column must be same in all sources
->There are following types of join:
1. inner join / equi join/ default join : return common or matching rows
2. outer join /full outer join 		: return all rows from both tables	
	a. left join 			: return all rows from left table and matching 

from right table
	b. right join 			: return all rows from right table and 

matching from left table


Other types of join:
	1. cross join/cartisan product 
	2. self join    : from between same table(make a two alias of same table)


Subquery : is nested query (query inside query)
==================


View : is virtual table or wrapper over the table
==============
->view doesn't contain/store data physically
->view contains only structure 
->view can be used as physical table 
->dml , ddl command can not be used within view
->dml command can be used over the view 


QQ
